        High school student Zunair Viqar commits suicide after his ex-bestfriend uploads a video of Zunair bullying him one year ago, and the video shatters his reputation and dignity. To find out what really happened and the events that led to Zunair's suicide, the film jumps back when it all started with a truth and dare game. The game started with Zunair explaining the rules of the game and other friends joining the game with the host of the game as a "supposedly" AI robot.

      But, as the game proceeded, it got more dangerous, with surveillance footage of each friend showing that the robot hacked into the webcams of their electronic devices. The person controlling the robot reveals himself as Zunair's bully victim, as he clarifies his intents to gain closure and get revenge of what Zunair did to him in the past. By leaking the bullying video over social media, this destroys Zunair's character and status over social media as his friends condemn him for his actions and he gets suspended from school.
